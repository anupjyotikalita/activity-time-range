Check the following screenshots that will explain various aspects of the app interface-
1. The homepage of the web app displays the available users list in a grid system.

2. On clicking one of the usercards, a modal will show up. It will display the time range on the current day during which the user was active. If he/she was not active during the day, then it will just show an empty message.

**For testing, choose a date between September 07, 2020 and September 12, 2020 as every user has atleast one active time range for these days. Every user has activities scattered in various months. Choosing a date that does not have an active time range, will just show the empty data message.**

3. The modal has two buttons on its header. The right button closes the modal and the left button is used to toggle a calendar to pick a date.
